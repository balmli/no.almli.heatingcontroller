# Heating Controller

The 'Heating Controller' is a device for easily controlling temperatures and modes for thermostats and sockets for heating.

To switch between 'Comfort' and 'ECO' modes, just two flows are necessary:

* one 'Comfort' flow with comfort temperatures and modes,
* and one 'ECO' flow with ECO temperatures and modes.

Each 'HeatingController' device has its own schedule that can be changed from 'Advanced settings'. Several devices can be used, each with their own schedule.

The app has support for public holidays for several countries, and utility prices for Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, France, Netherlands, Nordic and Baltic countries.

## Install

To install the device:

1. Add the 'Heating Controller' device.
2. Go to 'Advanced settings' and adjust the schedule.
3. Select 'Price area' and 'Currency' for utility prices.
4. Select 'Country for holidays' for public and bank holidays.

### Default schedule

Default schedule:

- Comfort mode for working days: 05:00 - 22:30
- Comfort mode for weekends and holidays: 07:00 - 23:00
- Work hours: 07:00 - 14:00

## Modes

The device has modes for:

- Home / Away
- Night / Day
- At work / Not at work
- Home override

The device can be turned 'On' / 'Off' to switch between 'Home' and 'Away' - modes.  If going away for a few days or on a holiday the device can be switched off to enable energy saving mode.  The device must be switched on again to switch back to 'Home' mode, or the 'Set away, and automatically switch to home mode on next schedule' action can be used to automatically go back to 'Home' mode when the next 'Night / Day' or 'At work / Not at work' modes triggers.

It is not neccessary to switch to 'Away' mode if going to work, ref. the 'At work' - mode.

The 'Night' and 'At work' modes are automatically set based on time, day of week and public holidays.  The start and end hours can be configured for both 'Night' and 'At work'.

The 'Home override' mode can be used to keep comfort mode on, even if 'At work'.  The 'Set home override on, and automatically off on next schedule' action can be used to automatically turn the 'Home override' mode off when the next 'Night / Day' or 'At work / Not at work' modes triggers.

## Comfort and ECO mode triggers

The 'Comfort mode' and 'ECO mode' triggers can be used to turn heaters on / off, or set the thermostat temperatures or thermostat modes, and will trigger if the 'Home', 'Night', 'At work' or 'Home override' modes changes.

#### Rules

- 'Comfort mode': 'Home' and 'Day' and 'Not at work' or 'Home override' and 'Day'
- 'ECO mode': otherwise

#### Example

Adjust the target temperature for thermostats based on comfort / ECO modes.  The target temperature for a thermostat is set to 22 ℃ for the period between 05:00 - 07:00 and 14:00 - 22:30, and 19 ℃ in the period from 07:00 - 14:00 and 22:30 - 24:00.

![Example](https://balmli.github.io/no.almli.heatingcontroller/example1.png "Example 1")

Needs two flows:

* **Flow 1**: WHEN: Comfort mode is enabled
  THEN: Set thermostat temperature to 22 ℃.
* **Flow 2**: WHEN: ECO mode is enabled
  THEN Set thermostat temperature to 19 ℃.

## Utility price changed trigger

The 'Utility price changed' will trig every hour, based on utility prices in the Nordpool area.  The price area and currency can be configured.

## 'Current price is among the X hours of lowest between START and END' condition

The 'Current price is among the X hours of lowest between START and END' condition can be used to find the X lowest prices in a period of the day.

#### Example

Charge the car for four hours between '22:00' and '06:00' with the lowest prices.

Needs one flow:

- **Flow**: WHEN: Utility price changed
  AND: Current price is among the 4 hours of lowest between '22:00' and '06:00'
  THEN: Start charging
  ELSE: Stop charging

## 'The following X consecutive hours have the lowest total price between START and END' condition

Use the 'The following X consecutive hours have the lowest total price between START and END' condition to find a period of X consecutive hours with the lowest total price in a given period. 

#### Example

Start the washing machine for four hours with the lowest total price between '20:00' and '08:00' the next day.

Needs one flow:

- **Flow**: WHEN: Utility price changed
  AND: The washing machine is not running
  AND: The following 4 consecutive hours have the lowest total price between '20:00' and '08:00'
  THEN: Start the washing machine

## Average price condition

The 'Current price is X percent above / below today's average' conditions will compare the current price to the average price for the whole day.

#### Example

Turn the socket for the water heater 'Off' when the price is 3 % higher than the average for the whole day, and 'On' otherwise.

Needs one flow:

- **Flow**: WHEN: Utility price changed
  AND: Current price is 3 percent above today's average
  THEN: Turn socket off,
  ELSE: Turn socket on

## High prices trigger

The 'High prices X hours of the day' trigger can be used to turn heaters off or lower the thermostat temperatures if 'ECO mode' is enabled and the utility prices are high.  The number of hours for high prices can be selected.

#### Rules

- Only hours where 'ECO mode' is enabled are controlled
- The selected number of hours with the highest prices are found
- If there are two consecutive hours with high prices the second hour is skipped, to avoid having heaters turned off too long, or having thermostat temperatures to low too long

#### Example

Set the target temperature for a thermostat to 22 ℃ during daytime, not at work and not away, 19 ℃ during the night, at work or away, and 17 ℃ when prices are high and at night, at work or away.

![Example](https://balmli.github.io/no.almli.heatingcontroller/example2.png "Example 2")

Needs three flows:

* **Flow 1**: WHEN: High prices 6 hours of the day
  AND: Logic 'Heating' is Yes
  THEN: set thermostat temperature to 22 ℃.
* **Flow 2**: High prices 6 hours of the day
  AND: Logic 'Heating' is No
  AND: Logic 'High price' is No
  THEN: set thermostat temperature to 19 ℃.
* **Flow 3**: High prices 6 hours of the day
  AND: Logic 'Heating' is No
  AND: Logic 'High price' is Yes
  THEN: set thermostat temperature to 17 ℃.

## Low prices trigger

The 'Low prices X hours of the day' trigger can be used to keep a heater on if the utility price is low and off if the utility price is high.  The 'Comfort mode' / 'ECO mode' is not taken into consideration for this trigger.

#### Example

Turn the socket for the water heater 'On' during the 18 hours with the lowest prices of the day, and 'Off' the other 6 hours.

![Example](https://balmli.github.io/no.almli.heatingcontroller/example3.png "Example 3")

Needs one flow:

- **Flow**: WHEN: 'Low prices 18 hours of the day'  
  AND: Logic 'low price' is Yes
  THEN: Turn socket on
  ELSE: Turn socket off

## Mode triggers

The 'Home mode set to on', 'Home mode set to off', 'Home override set to on' and 'Home override set to off' will trigger based on changes to 'Home' and 'Home override' modes.

The 'Night starts', 'Night ends', 'At work starts' and 'At work ends' will trigger based on changes to the 'Night' and 'At work' modes.
